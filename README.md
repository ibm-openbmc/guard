# GUARD

Guarding the system against failures by permanently isolating faulty units.
guard records contains the permanently isolated components details. GUARD
repository provides the libraries and tools to create/list/delete guard records

## Building

Need `meson` and `ninja`. Alternatively, source an OpenBMC ARM/x86 SDK.

```
meson build && ninja -C build
```

To use power system device for guard FRU's.

```
meson build -Ddevtree=enabled && ninja -C build
```

To build libguard with verbose level to get required trace.\
Supported verbose level:\
`0` - Emergency, `1` - Alert, `2` - Critical, `3` - Error, `4` - Warning, `5` -
Notice, `6` - Info, `7` - Debug\
By default verbose level is Error.

```
meson build -Dverbose=7 && ninja -C build
```

## To run unit tests

Tests can be run in the CI docker container, or with an OpenBMC x86 sdk(see
below for x86 steps).

```
meson -Doe-sdk=enabled -Dtests=enabled build
ninja -C build test
```

## Usage of GUARD tool

```

guard --help
GUARD Tool
Usage: guard [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -h,--help                Guard CLI tool options
  -c,--create TEXT         Create Guard record, expects physical path as input
  -i,--invalidate FLOAT    Invalidate a single Guard record, expects record id
                           as input
  -I,--invalidate-all      Invalidates all the Guard records
  -l,--list                List all the GUARD'ed resources
  -r,--reset               Erase all the Guard records
  -v,--version             Version of GUARD tool

```

**Note:** Physical path can be fetched from device tree, using
ATTR_PHYS_DEV_PATH attribute of the corresponding target. Physical path formats
supported by guard tool:-

- physical:sys-0/node-0/proc-0/mc-0/mi-0/mcc-0
- /sys-0/node-0/proc-0/mc-0/mi-0/mcc-0
- sys-0/node-0/proc-0/mc-0/mi-0/mcc-0

### Examples

- To create a guard record.

```
guard -c sys-0/node-0/proc-0/mc-0/mi-0/mcc-0
Success
```

- To list the guard records present in a system.

```
guard -l
ID       | ERROR    |  Type  | Path
00000001 | 00000000 | manual | physical:sys-0/node-0/proc-0/mc-0/mi-0/mcc-0
```

- To erase all the guard records

```
guard -r
```

- To invalidate a single guard record

```
guard -i 1
```

- To invalidate all the guard records

```
guard -I
```
